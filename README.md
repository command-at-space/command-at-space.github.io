2D Space Roguelite Game

## **LORE**

80 years after the events of <a class="real" href="https://endless-sky.github.io/">Endless Sky</a>, space has suffered many changes. Worm holes have dissapeared. Humans have lost all contact with any alien race  
The <strong>Republic</strong> has been getting weaker day by day. Has lost two thirds of its systems due to wars or independence movements.  
The <strong>Syndicate</strong> finally became independent of The Republic. Now The Syndicate is a handful of megacorporations fighting each other.  
<strong>Free Worlds</strong> is the new emerging power. It has been expanding for decades.   
<strong>Pirates</strong> have been a growing problem.With a galaxy increasingly divided piracy is a very lucrative business.  
<strong>Northern League</strong> is the safest and most advanced region of space.They got independence at the same time as the Mining Federation.  
<strong>Mining Federation</strong> are the main suppliers of raw materials throughout the galaxy.  
The <strong>Far North</strong> is the new Wild West. Without law or government, law of the jungle reigns.  
<strong>Independent Faction</strong>
