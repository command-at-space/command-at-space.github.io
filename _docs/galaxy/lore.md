The **Republic** has been getting weaker day by day. Has lost two thirds of its systems due to wars or independence movements.  
The **Syndicate** finally became independent of The Republic. Now The Syndicate is a handful of megacorporations fighting each other.

**Pirates** have been a growing problem.With a galaxy increasingly divided piracy is a very lucrative business.

**Mining Federation** are the main suppliers of raw materials throughout the galaxy.  
The **Far North** is the new Wild West. Without law or government, law of the jungle reigns.
